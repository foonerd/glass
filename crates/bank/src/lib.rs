//! The spectrum bank: the analyser behind every spectrum Glass draws.
//!
//! Pure compute, no I/O. Fed the last `window` samples of each channel on
//! the unit scale, it runs a real-input FFT per channel through a Hann
//! window, projects the magnitudes onto the bands a theme asks for (up to
//! 256 over 20 Hz to 20 kHz, under log, mel or linear spacing), scales them
//! so a full-scale sine inside a band reads 1.0, and keeps a peak hold per
//! band that falls with a quarter-second half-life. The frame also carries
//! an onset per band group and the left-right correlation per band, for
//! renderers that want them.
//!
//! The capture advances by [`HOP`] samples between measurements while the
//! FFT looks at a longer window, so the cadence stays near 47 a second and
//! the resolution comes from the window. Log spacing is the ANSI/IEC S1.11
//! base-10 equal-ratio partition, the music-analyser convention. Adjacent
//! bands that would read the same FFT bins are told apart at construction:
//! the range is split when the window allows, else the bands share it with
//! triangular weights, so a dense bank never shows plateaus.
//!
//! Numerical code with explicit indexed loops over parallel per-band
//! arrays; the iterator forms the lint asks for would hide the shape.
